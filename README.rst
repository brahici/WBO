WBO
===

WBO is the source code for my personal web site.

It's powered by Django. Data persists in a sqlite3 database.

WBO uses jQuery and some plugins:

- jQuery (http://jquery.com)
- Collapse plugin for jQuery (http://github.com/danielstocks/jQuery-Collapse/)

jQuery is loaded from Google APIS and the plugins are shipped with WBO.

Fonts are loaded from Google Fonts.
